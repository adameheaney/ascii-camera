# About
This Python program converts your webcam to [ASCII ART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) using the opencv cv2 package, and displays the text  
on a window using tkinter.

Combining this program with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), you can make a virtual camera of the ASCII window and effectively make it look like your  
camera is an ASCII camera!

This is my first Python program and I learned a lot about how simple Python truly is with its many packages and few lines of code.

# Set-up
The executable folder is located in the dist folder, making a shortcut to it is recommended. Opening this file will run the program, starting your device's camera and opening up the window displaying yourself in all the ASCII beauty.

Upon closing the window, the program is completely stopped, so there is no need to worry about your camera still being active.
